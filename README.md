The Cesium ion Blender add-on enables you to effortlessly publish and stream 3D models on the web.

Leveraging Cesium ion and the power of 3D Tiles, even multi-gigabyte models can be streamed to any device without having to download the entire tileset up front. By visualizing 3D Tiles with CesiumJS, you can fuse your models with other datasets, add geospatial context to place it at a real world location, or overlay additional details and analysis.

# ion-blender-exporter

Blender is a keystone of the 3D editing community, with the addition of the glTF exporter we wanted to make the process easier of getting your assets into [Cesium ion](https://cesium.com/). Anyone with a [Cesium ion](https://cesium.com/) account can take their models directly from Blender and have them available as 3DTiles within a matter of minutes. Whether the model is photogrammetry that was polished in Blender or is a 3D model of a city, ion can process that data to be available in an online and global context.
